Overview
• In the notes we saw a solution to the produce consumer problem with bounded
buffers. The solution involved two semaphores (haveData, and haveSpace), plus
a mutex. In this assignment you will use that solution to manage access to a
bounded buffer storing candy!
• One group of threads will model candy factories which generate candy one at a
time and insert the candy into the bounded buffer. Another group of threads will
model kids which eat candy one a time1 from the bounded buffer.
• Your program, called candykids, will accept three arguments:
• ./candykids <#factories> <#kids> <#seconds>
• Example: ./candykids 3 1 10
• # Factories: Number of candy-factory threads to spawn.
• # Kids: Number of kid threads to spawn.
• # Seconds: Number of seconds to allow the factory threads to run for.
Produce/Consumer Operation
Main
• Your main() function will start and control the application. Its steps are as 
follows:
• main() {
• // 1. Extract arguments
• // 2. Initialize modules
• // 3. Launch candy-factory threads
• // 4. Launch kid threads
• // 5. Wait for requested time
• // 6. Stop candy-factory threads
• // 7. Wait until no more candy
• // 8. Stop kid threads
• // 9. Print statistics
• // 10. Cleanup any allocated memory
• }
1. Extract Arguments
As described in the Overview section, process the arguments passed on the
command line. All arguments must be greater than 0.
◦ If any argument is 0 or less, display an error and exit the program.
2. Initialize Modules
Do any module initialization. You will have at least two modules: bounded buffer,
and statistics. If not initialization is required by your implementation, you may
skip this.
3. Launch factory threads
Spawn the requested number of candy-factory threads. To each thread, pass it its
factory number: 0 to (number of factories - 1).
Hint: Store the thread IDs in an array because you'll need to join on them later.
Hint: Don't pass each thread a reference to the same variable because as you
change the variable's value for the next thread, there's no guaranty the previous
thread will have read the previous value yet. You can use an array to have a
different variable for each thread.
4. Launch kid threads
Spawn the requested number of kid threads.
5. Wait for requested time
In a loop, call sleep(1). Loop as many times as the “# Seconds” command line
argument.
◦ Print the number of seconds running each time, such as “Time 3s” after
the 3rd sleep. This shows time ticking away as your program executes.
6. Stop factory threads
Indicate to the factory threads that they are to finish, and then call join for each
factory thread. See section on candy-factory threads (below) for more.
7. Wait until no more candy
While there is still candy in the bounded buffer (check by calling a method in
your bounded buffer module), print “Waiting for all candy to be consumed” and
sleep for 1 second.
8. Stop kid threads
For each kid thread, cancel the thread and then join the thread. For example, if a
thread ID is stored in daThreadID, you would run:
pthread_cancel(daThreadId);
pthread_join(daThreadId, NULL);
9. Print statistics
Call the statistics module to display the statistics. See statistics section below.
10. Cleanup any allocated memory
Free any dynamically allocated memory. You may need to call cleanup functions
in your statistics and bounded buffer modules if they need to free any memory.
